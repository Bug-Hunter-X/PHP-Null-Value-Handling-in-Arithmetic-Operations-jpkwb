# PHP Null Value Handling in Arithmetic Operations

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP where null values are silently converted to 0 in arithmetic operations, potentially leading to unexpected and incorrect results. The `bug.php` file shows the problem, while `bugSolution.php` provides the correct solution.

**Problem:**
PHP's loose typing can cause issues when dealing with null values. Arithmetic operations involving null are implicitly treated as 0, which can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug errors.  This is especially problematic when null signifies the absence of a value, and treating it as zero is not logically accurate. 

**Solution:**
The solution involves explicitly checking for null values before performing any arithmetic calculations and handling them appropriately (returning null, throwing an exception, or using a default value).
